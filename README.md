# Movie DB ðŸŽ¥

> PROD [Live] : https://moviedb-prod.netlify.app/

#### Movie DB consists of a straight forward user interface where there is a
- List of movies by default is set to batman, a search form to query for specific movies as we are typing.
- To get more details of a specific movie in the list, click on any **movie poster** which is set to route to another page where it shows the movie info along with a *Back to Movies* button to come back to **Homepage**.
- For each page render the **Loading** animation has been implemented and unknown route URLs are handled by the **error** message coming from API.
- When a query doesn't have any movies matching, it still shows the old list but it shows an **error** message below the search form and API handles it.
- To run the project locally, clone the repo, `npm install` to install the dependencies and `npm start` to start up the development server on default port 3000.
